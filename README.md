# Python Bootcamp

Python Bootcamp is a collection of Python code snippets to learn Python programming language. The notebook files are organized in a way that you can learn Python from scratch.
These snippets can be taken as `Python, the good parts`. There are much more content and details in the official Python documentation.

There is also a very simple object recognition example using [ImageAI](https://imageai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This simple example could tie together the concepts you learned in the notebook files.
